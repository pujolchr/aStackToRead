# a stackToRead
* I got a lot of stuff to read.  
* Mostly url of webpages or articles or tutorial ar other stuff.
* I usually keep this list in difernt places, on a note app on my draft in gmail
, in mai that i send to myself.

**LET TRY TO ORGANIZE THAT**

let's do a page/app that let me:
1. push an url in front of the stack
2. append an url in the end of the stack
3. pop an url from the font of the stack
4. 


TODO: 
* basic html page (bootstrap)
