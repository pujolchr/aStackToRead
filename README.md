# a stackToRead
* I got a lot of stuff to read.  
* Mostly url of webpages or articles or tutorial ar other stuff.
* I usually keep this list in difernt places, on a note app on my draft in gmail
, in mai that i send to myself.

**LET TRY TO ORGANIZE THAT**

Let's do a page/app that let me:
1. push an url on the top of the stack
2. append an url at the end of the stack
3. pop an url from the font of the stack and open the
   corespondent web page
4. save and store the stack on local storage.
 
Using `React` please cause  I need to learn it.
