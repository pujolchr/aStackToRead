# a stackToRead
* I got a lot of stuff to read.  
* Mostly url of webpages or articles or tutorial ar other stuff.
* I usually keep this list in difernt places, on a note app on my draft in gmail
, in mai that i send to myself.

## LET TRY TO ORGANIZE THAT

Let's do a page/app that let me:
1. push an url on the top of the stack
2. append an url at the end of the stack
3. pop an url from the font of the stack and open the
   corespondent web page
4. save and store the stack on local storage.
 
Using `React` please cause  I need to learn it.


TODO: 
- [x] ~~basic html page~~
- [x] ~~basic register url~~
- [x] ~~**storage** how to do local storage~~

## Next steps 

Suggestions for further development:

* parse the saved url and set the name of the item in function of
  the title of the page
* check number of item
* remote storage of stack
* delete stack
* pluggin firefox / chrome
* tagging the url and sort different stack in  function of the tag
* user auth
* stand alone app ios android
